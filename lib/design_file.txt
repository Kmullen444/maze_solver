Write a prpogram that will find a route between tow points in a maze


Need to get the maze from the file
  Put the maze in a matix
  Find the start point(maybe hardcode)
  Path should not be self-intersecting
  Work throught the maze checking if the side has either blank 
    or if it the has a "*"
    if it doesn't put a block in
      if it does do nothing
  Print the maze to the terminal

Maze-finder class
Maze-finder#maze_create(return a matrix with the maze in it)
#find-start(index of "S")
#find-end  (index of "E")


  Work throught the maze checking if the side has either blank 
  or if it the has a "*"

#find-end (starting from the start index work through the maze until the end)
  Look at each space next to the blank ones ie. [i, i -1] and [i, i + 1]
#print_maze (print the maze to the terminal)
