Need to get the maze from the file
  Put the maze in a matix
  Find the start point(maybe hardcode)
  Path should not be self-intersecting
  Work throught the maze checking if the side has either blank 
    or if it the has a "*"
    if it doesn't put a block in
      if it does do nothing
  Print the maze to the terminal
